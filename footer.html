                <p>The Calculators here-in are tools designed for inspectors and engineer to rapidly and consistent with
                    the required steps, validate pass/fail screening requirements of in-service systems found with
                    defects using the methodology of API579-1 FFS in the applicable Level 1 and Level 2 scenarios as per
                    applicable defects. It is not intended to replace provincial/state requirements, Design Code

                    API579-1 code of the defect analysed and this tool. Detailed/Advanced engineering analysis (Level 3)
                    are required when the limitations as detailed in the code relate to a system in question and where
                    the software application specifies or states limitations of critical variables not accounted for. A
                    competent engineer is responsible for assessing the design of the system and assuring that internal
                    pressure is the proper design criteria for continued use. Engineering analysis, Good judgment and

                <p class="center bold">Our Vision: Support and develop our client's technical capacity while creating
                    trust</p>
                <p>Often times, Inspectors and engineers have to make prompt, accurate and sound decisions with respect
                    to the general Mechanical Integrity and Structural Fitness for continued use of in-service systems
                    (piping, Pressure Vessels, Tanks and peripheral) when indications are found and classified as defect
                    WRT their design standards and operating conditions.</p>


                <p>Currently, Plant, Reliability and Asset integrity engineers usually have to go through various
                    standards and develop models to compute L1/L2 structural integrity assessments to make Go/No-Go
                    calls during plant runtime and Outage work windows for continued running, repair, replace and
                    required level of follow work. Nowadays, inspectors are becoming more engaged and required to make
                    such calls too. This is usually time consuming and many times when challenged are found with may
                    inconsistencies based on the risk tolerance of the engineer.</p>


                <p>Another approach has been to involve 3rd party consultants with the expectation of advanced
                    knowledge. It doesn't solve the problem of prompt delivery and comes often times with a high price
                    tag as well as errors in modelling due to limited 1st hand field knowledge of the defect/system and
                    interpreting customer inspection information while offsite.</p>


                <p>The level of assessment, quality of the results and final decision directly affects the plants
                    safety, Reliability, productivity and thus bottom-line. Industrywide (Chemical and Petrochemical)
                    approximately 10% of defects require in-depth and advanced (Level 3) Fitness for Service evaluations
                    which may involve custom modelling and FEA analysis. The other 90% need less rigor. A design
                    standard and Level 1 or 2 fitness for service evaluation is appropriate and usually sufficient. The
                    focus of Rapidsolve™ is these 90%.</p>


                <p>Rapidsolve™ is developed to give prompt, accurate and consistent L1/L2 defect evaluation and results
                    in minutes.<br>

                    Rapidsolve™ is Modelled primarily around the API579-1 FFS and many years of engineering judgement.
                    The code validations were done by certified engineers and SMEs using actual plants defect findings,
                    and case scenarios in API579-1 and API579-2. A good understanding of the concept of FFS as specified
                    in API597-1 is required to properly use and interpret the results using this application.</p>


                <p>Rapidsolve™ is not intended to replace provincial/state requirements, Design Standard guidelines and
                    user-owner risk profile models. It is not a detailed engineering analysis and not intended to be a
                    comprehensive tool. The tool does not generally take into consideration outside level 1 and Level 2
                    assessment approaches as well as several complex external loads and conditions. Use of this tool
                    requires adequate knowledge of the steps and limitations as specified in the applicable design
                    standard and FFS-API579-1 standard of the defect analyzed. Engineering analysis plus Level 3 are
                    required when the limitations as detailed in the standard relate to a system in question. The
                    software entails the following features and level of assessment capabilities:</p>

                <h3>Who should attend?</h3>

                <p>This course is designed for plant personnel who are engaged in design, inspection and maintenance and
                    repair of fixed equipment. (Tanks, Pressure Vessels and piping). This would typically include
                    experienced Unit Inspectors, Plant Engineers, Asset Integrity Specialist and engineers, Operations
                    Engineers, Maintenance Engineers, Welding Engineers and allied personnel. A general working
                    knowledge of this class of equipment, and their usual construction materials is a requirement to
                    attend this course.</p>


                <p>The training provides direction for performing flaw/defect assessments using API 579-1/ASME FFS
                    recommended practices as it applies to fixed pressure equipment. The training is a hands-on approach
                    with participants completing actual plant/field examples. This is aided using RAPIDSOLVETM; a FFS
                    software application to further reinforces the presentation and understanding of solutions and
